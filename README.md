## The North Cardinal Project

North Cardinal is a project to empower small growers in Canada with a free
and open source solution to facilitate growth and commercialization of
controlled narcotics such as marijuana.

The ultimate goal is to ease the requirements enforced on growers by Health
Canada by providing full solution for the growth and sale of medical marijuana.

**The project is very recent and is not in its current state a viable solution.**
